# Loco WordPress Plugin

### Legacy 1.x branch

This is a Git mirror of the **deprecated** version of the official Loco WordPress plugin:  

[http://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/](http://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/)

There is **no support** for the legacy version as the 2.x is now the active branch. If for any reason you cannot use the 2.x version of this plugin, you can install the old version by checking out the appropriate stable tag.


## Installation

Add the plugin to your WordPress project via Git as follows:

    $ git submodule add git@github.com:loco/wp-loco.git wp-content/plugins/loco-translate
    
If you want to use a stable release listed in the WordPress plugin directory, you can checkout by tag, e.g:

    $ cd wp-content/plugins/loco-translate 
    $ git fetch origin --tags
    $ git checkout tags/1.5.6
