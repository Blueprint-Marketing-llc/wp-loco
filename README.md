### Translate plugins and themes directly in your browser

Gitified version of the official Loco Wordpress plugin:

## Installation

Note that the actual name of the plugin is "loco-translate" not "wp-loco". It's renamed on Github to differentiate it as a Wordpress plugin. 

Add the plugin to your Wordpress project via Git as follows:

    $ git submodule add git@github.com:loco/wp-loco.git wp-content/plugins/loco-translate
    
If you want to use a stable release listed in the Wordpress plugin directory, you can checkout by tag, e.g.:

    $ cd wp-content/plugins/loco-translate 
    $ git fetch origin
    $ git checkout tags/1.4.2
